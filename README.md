# Molecular Drivers of 13cRA Resistance in Neuroblastoma

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system
with highly heterogeneous clinical outcomes, with over 90% survival in
patients with low-risk disease and under 50% survival in patients with
high-risk disease. In addition, 25% of patients with high-risk disease
proceed to tumor relapse, at which point patient survival drops to under
15%. Tumor relapse occurs due to tumor cells escaping maintenance
therapy with 13-cis retinoic acid (13cRA), which targets residual tumor
cells that remain after treatment with the standard of care, an
intensive regimen including surgical resection, radiation, chemotherapy
with autologous stem cell rescue, and anti-GD2 immunotherapy. The goal
of this project is to determine the tumor cell populations that are
resistant to 13cRA and the molecular drivers of this therapeutic
resistance. This will provide insight into how to target these resistant
tumor cell populations to reduce the risk of tumor relapse and improve
outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.
